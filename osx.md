# OSX

The Mac is clearly the best plaform for developers.  It's based on Unix (BSD) (the version the Mac uses is called "Darwin").  If you get a job writing python code, there's a high likelyhood that your code (when release) will need to run on a unix server.  So why not run unix on your development environment?  With the Mac, you've got all the power of Unix under the hood, but you've got a user interface that's actually -- usable! (Unlike those Linux weenies).

## What Version are you on?
You can figure out what version of OSX you're on if you click on the apple icon in the top left corner and go to about this mac.



- 10.9: Mavericks
- 10.8: Mountain Lion

Versions that require additional work to configure

- 10.7: Lion 
- 10.6: Snow Leopard

Extra difficulty
- 10.5: Leopard


## Install

### XCode
Xcode is the set of developer tools, provided by Apple, for the Mac.  We're not going to be developing in Xcode, but we do need to use some of the components that Xcode provides.  They're not installed by default.  If you're on a recent Mac, run the "App Store" app and you can install Xcode from there.

Whatever version of OSX you're on, after you install you'll need to launch XCode at least once to agree to the Terms of Service.



####Mavericks, Mountain Lion

- Download and install through the mac App Store
- open xcode agree to terms of service

If you're on mavericks, open the `terminal` and run `xcode-select â€”install`

For Mountain Lion, Open Xcode, open Xcode menu bar(top left) > Preferences > Downloads Tab > click install for command line tools.

XCode 5.1 broke some things that are particularly annoying. Add the following lines to your .bashrc or .bash_profile:
````bash
export CFLAGS=-Qunused-arguments
export CPPFLAGS=-Qunused-arguments
````

#### Lion

Update OSX to at least 10.7.4

Download an Xcode Version 4.6.3 from Apple's developer web site.  You'll need a Apple Developer Account to log in, but it's free:

https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action

- Download and install through the link above
- open xcode agree to terms of service
- Open Xcode, open Xcode menu bar(top left) > Preferences > Downloads Tab > click install for command line tools.

#### Snow Leopard

Older Macs will want to download older version Xcode from Apple's developer web site or from your original installation discs.  You'll need a Apple Developer Account to log in, but it's free:

https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action

- Download and install through the link above
- open xcode agree to terms of service
- Open Xcode, open Xcode menu bar(top left) > Preferences > Downloads Tab > click install for command line tools.


## Setup Python

OSX comes with Python (cool, huh?)  But there's a couple of things missing that will make our lives easier.

Run the following commands in your terminal window:

````bash
sudo easy_install pip
sudo pip install virtualenv python-twitter
````


###Sublime Text 2
Sublime Text is a very popular editor for developers and what we us on our pair programming workstations.  Download a copy from:

http://www.sublimetext.com/

Sublime is very cusomizable (which is probably one of the reasons it is so popular).  Every developer is different, so customize to your own style, but here are some recommendataions:

####Format for Python
Press Command-, (comma) to open the Preferences.sublime-settings file.  Add the following lines:

````
{
  "tab_size": 4,
  "translate_tabs_to_spaces": false,
  "rulers": [80]
}
````

####subl on the Command Line
To be able to type "subl" on the command line like we do on the pair programming workstations, create the following symbloic link from the Terminal:

````
sudo ln -s /Applications/Sublime\ Text\ 2.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl /usr/local/bin
````

####Package Control
Sublime has its own package manager that makes it easy to install additioanl sublime plugins.  Follow the instructions at the link below to install it:

https://sublime.wbond.net/installation

#####pylint
The pair programming workstations at Hackbright have the pylint plugin installed.  That's what generates those little red and yellow icons showing you where potential syntax errors in your code may be before you run it.  Use the Package Manager you installed above to install the pyline plugin.

#####SublimeLinter
There is a more general linter that handles more than Python called SublimeLinter. The link to install it for Sublime Text 2 is https://sublime.wbond.net/installation#st2

####More
This is a good place to start if you'd like to customize Sublime further:

###Heroku Client 
- https://toolbelt.heroku.com/

###postgres.app 
PostgreSQL is a Database Server.  Using PostgreSQL is not required during the Hackbright Curriculum, however many student projects that use a database will take advantage of it (especially if you deploy on heroku).

- http://postgresapp.com/

- add postgres.app to the `$PATH` variable for compiling pg extensions (pyscopg adapter later) by adding the following to the bottom of `~/.profile` (or ~/.zshrc if you've installed it.)

````bash
# For Postgres.app

export PATH="/Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/9.3/bin:$PATH"
````

### homebrew 
- http://brew.sh/
- scroll to the bottom and find the ruby -e command. Run that to get



## Configuring SSH
### ssh-keygen
#### If you have already done this for github, don't do it again.

` mkdir ~/.ssh && cd ~/.ssh`

`ssh-keygen`
This will ask you several questions. I would recommend leaving the name of the file as id_rsa & setting a good passphrase.


test it by running  `ssh git@github.com` (hit yes to confirm RSA sig)

you should see something like
````
PTY allocation request failed on channel 0

Hi GITHUB NAME! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.

Connection to github.com closed.
````
